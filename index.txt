Downloading FCP-INDI Neuroimaging Data from Amazon S3
======================================================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data for the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI are now available for download from an Amazon Web Services `S3 bucket <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_.

There are file transfer programs that can handle S3 natively and will allow you to navigate through the data using a file browser. `Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_ is one such program that works with Windows and Mac OS X. Cyberduck also has a `command line version <https://duck.sh>`_ that works with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Instructions for using Cyberduck are as follows: 

#. Open Cyberduck and click on *Open Connection*.
#. Set the application protocol in the dropdown menu to *S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)*.
#. Set the server to *s3.amazonaws.com*.
#. Check the box labelled *Anonymous Login*.
#. Expand the More Options tab and set Path to *fcp-indi/data/Projects*.
#. Click *Connect*.

The end result should appear as follows:

Accessing Individual Datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have navigated to *fcp-indi/data/Projects*, you will be presented with individual directories for all of the datasets we have available:

.. csv-table::
    :file: _static/datasets.csv

Generally, subdirectories within these datasets conform to the following scheme:

* RawDataBIDS : Raw data organized in the `BIDS format <http://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_. 
* RawDataTars : Aggregated individualized datasets in the `BIDS format <http://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_ shared as tarred and gzipped files of approximately 2-4 GB each.
* Outputs : Derivatives of raw data (such as outputs from Freesurfer, field map-corrected ata, and C-PAC outputs).
